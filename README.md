# ELI Unified Dashboard

> **Last Updated:** December 12, 2025 (Topology Graph Reporting)

## Executive Summary – ELI for Peru

**What ELI Does**
ELI is Peru’s national “single pane of glass” for security and intelligence, unifying camera networks, analytics systems, and incident reports across the country into one live dashboard. It allows national and regional leaders to see what is happening now, where it is happening, and how risks are evolving over time.

**Why It Is Useful for Peru**
- Strengthens situational awareness for the National Police, Armed Forces, and civil protection by giving them a shared, real-time picture of incidents and risks across all regions.
- Reduces response time by linking alerts, maps, video evidence, and incident reports in a single, coordinated workflow.
- Supports strategic decision-making by turning millions of individual events into clear trends, hotspots, and risk indicators that can be discussed at the ministerial and national security level.

**Where We Are Going Next**
Over the next phases, ELI will evolve from a unified viewer into a full intelligence platform for Peru by:
- Adding graph-based intelligence to understand how people, vehicles, locations, and events are connected.
- Building a secure evidence pipeline for storing and reviewing video and images at national scale.
- Expanding AI and predictive analytics to highlight anomalies early and anticipate emerging threats.
- Integrating more deeply with existing national programs and command centers, so ELI becomes the common operating picture for Peru’s security institutions.

**Peru's National Surveillance & Intelligence Platform**

A comprehensive, full-stack surveillance dashboard that unifies three separate systems (ELI-DEMO, eli-dashboard, and IREX-DEMO) into a single, cohesive application with real-time webhook processing, advanced analytics, and Peru-themed design.

| Geographic Map | Camera markers | View Details, Create Incident, Add to POLE, View Events, View in Topology, Mark as High Risk |
| Geographic Map | Region boundaries | View Details, Create Incident, Add to POLE, View in Topology, Mark as High Risk (all cameras) |

*View Events only available for cameras/locations

### ⚡ Auto-Creation with Rich Mock Data

Instead of just opening a form, the "Create Incident" and "Add to POLE" actions now **automatically generate rich, realistic data** based on the selected node type:

1. **Crime Story Generation**: 
   - Uses context-aware templates (e.g., "Suspicious Activity" for cameras, "Plate Match" for vehicles).
   - Generates detailed descriptions with investigation notes.
   - Assigns Peruvian police units (DIRANDRO, DINOES, etc.) and officers.
   
2. **POLE Entity Intelligence**:
   - Creates detailed profiles with aliases (e.g., "El Lobo", "La Sombra").
   - Generates physical attributes and connection notes.
   - Assigns threat levels and relationship links back to the source node.

### 📋 Node Details Panel *(Enhanced Dec 11)*

Selecting **"View Details"** opens a comprehensive slide-out panel on the right side of the screen with:

- **Image Preview**: Full event image with "Open Full" link to Cloudinary
- **AI Scene Description**: Prominently displayed Gemini caption in gradient card
- **Event Details**: ID, Event ID, Channel, Timestamp, Region, Location coordinates
- **Vehicles Detected**: Styled badges with vehicle descriptions (e.g., "dark sedan", "white van")
- **License Plates**: Mono-font display with copy-on-click (grayed out for "obscured")
- **People & Clothing**: People count with clothing color badges
- **Weapons Alert**: Red highlighted section when weapons are detected
- **Extracted Text**: Any OCR text found in the image
- **Scene Environment**: Time of day, weather, lighting, camera perspective in grid layout

    end
    
    style SEARCH fill:#EAB308,color:#000
    style RESULT fill:#22C55E,color:#fff
```

### Filter Behavior

When you click **Search** with filters selected:

1. **Non-matching nodes are hidden** - Only events matching your criteria are displayed
2. **Connected cameras/locations shown** - Related infrastructure nodes remain visible
3. **Matching events highlighted** - Gold color and increased size for easy identification
4. **Auto-zoom** - Graph automatically zooms to fit filtered results
5. **Toast notification** - Shows count of matching events found

Click **Clear** to restore the full graph.

### Settings Configuration

Configure Gemini AI processing in the **Settings** page:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Model** | Gemini model to use | `gemini-2.0-flash` |
| **Batch Size** | Images per CRON run | `100` |
| **Enabled** | Toggle AI processing | `false` |
| **Schedule** | Minutes between runs | `30` |

### Available Models

| Model | Description | Rate Limit |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| `gemini-2.0-flash` | Fast multimodal model (recommended) | 15 RPM |
| `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` | Lightweight, lower cost | 30 RPM |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | Latest with improved capabilities | 15 RPM |
| `gemini-2.5-pro` | Most capable for complex analysis | 2 RPM |

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/data/gemini-config` | GET/POST | Get/update Gemini configuration |
| `/api/data/gemini-search` | GET | Search events by AI metadata |
| `/api/data/gemini-models` | GET | List available models for API key |
| `/api/cron/process-gemini-images` | GET | Trigger image processing CRON |
| `/api/data/sync-gemini-neo4j` | POST | Backfill Gemini data from PostgreSQL to Neo4j |

### Gemini Neo4j Sync *(Fixed Dec 11)*

The Gemini AI analysis data is now properly synced to Neo4j Event nodes, enabling Cypher queries on the Topology screen. 

**What was fixed:**
- The `updateNeo4jEventWithGemini()` function was matching on the wrong field (`eventId` instead of `id`)
- Neo4j Event nodes are created with `id = eventDbId` (e.g., `evt_1765448367183_ry79lkofi`)
- The fix ensures Gemini properties are correctly saved to the matching Neo4j node

**Backfill existing data:**
```bash
# Sync processed snapshots to Neo4j (no re-analysis)
curl -X POST "https://eli.visiumtechnologies.com/api/data/sync-gemini-neo4j?limit=100"

# Re-analyze images and sync to Neo4j
curl -X POST "https://eli.visiumtechnologies.com/api/data/sync-gemini-neo4j?reanalyze=true&limit=50"
```

**Verify in Neo4j:**
```cypher
MATCH (e:Event) WHERE e.geminiProcessedAt IS NOT NULL
RETURN e.id, e.geminiCaption, e.geminiVehicles, e.geminiLicensePlates
LIMIT 10
```

### Search Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `hasWeapons` | boolean | Filter for weapon detection | `true` |
| `licensePlate` | string | Filter by plate number (* for any) | `ABC-123` or `*` |
| `minPeopleCount` | number | Minimum people in scene | `2` |
| `vehicleType` | string | Filter by vehicle type | `SUV` |
| `clothingColor` | string | Filter by clothing color | `black` |
| `limit` | number | Max results to return | `100` |

| Feature | Weight | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **License Plates** | 40% | Exact or partial plate number match |
| **Vehicle Attributes** | 25% | Matching type, make, or color |
| **Clothing Colors** | 15% | Any matching clothing colors |
| **People Count** | 10% | Exact or close match (±1 person) |
| **Scene Colors** | 5% | Similar dominant color palette |
| **Extracted Text** | 5% | Partial text/sign matches |

**Confidence Thresholds:**
- 🟢 **80%+** - High confidence match (green badge)
- 🟡 **50-79%** - Medium confidence (yellow badge)
- 🟠 **Below 50%** - Low confidence (orange badge)

### Extracted Metadata

The AI extracts the following from uploaded images:

| Field | Example Values |
|-------|---------------|
| Caption | "Nighttime urban street with parked vehicles" |
| Vehicles | SUV, sedan, pickup, motorcycle |
| License Plates | "ABC-123", "XYZ-789" |
| People Count | 3 |
| Clothing Colors | black, white, blue, red |

## Topology Graph Reporting *(New Dec 2025)*

Topology Graph Reporting turns an ad-hoc graph selection into a durable, shareable, executive-grade report.

It enables:

- Multi-select (Shift + drag lasso) across nodes
- AI-generated analysis using Google Gemini
- Issue flagging linked back to selected nodes/edges
- Reports table in Executive Dashboard
- Exports (JSON/CSV) and share links

### Step-by-step: How it works

1. **Select nodes**
   - On the Topology Graph page, hold **Shift** and drag to draw a selection box.
   - Selected nodes are highlighted and a selection card shows counts.

2. **Generate Summary**
   - Click **Generate Summary**.
   - The UI posts `nodeIds` (and optionally `edgeIds`) to `/api/data/topology-reports`.

3. **Backend builds context**
   - The API fetches full node + relationship properties from Neo4j for the selected IDs.
   - A structured prompt is assembled from those properties.

4. **Gemini generates the report**
   - The API calls the Google Generative Language `:generateContent` endpoint using `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
   - Response text is extracted as Markdown.

5. **Persist the report**
   - The report is stored in PostgreSQL (`topology_reports`), including selection IDs and a snapshot of the context in `metadata`.

6. **View, export, and share**
   - Reports appear in the Executive Dashboard “Reports” tab.
   - Reports can be exported as JSON/CSV and shared via `/share/report/:token`.

## 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

![Data flow sequence diagram showing event ingestion from IREX through webhook handler to databases](docs/images/ELI-DIAGRAM-DataFlowArchitecture.jpeg)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant IREX as IREX System
    participant WH as Webhook Handler
    participant PG as PostgreSQL
    participant NEO as Neo4j
    participant INF as InfluxDB
    participant UI as Dashboard UI
    
    Note over IREX,UI: Event Ingestion Flow
    IREX->>WH: POST /api/webhook/irex
    WH->>PG: Insert event, channel, snapshots
    WH->>NEO: Sync camera node
    WH->>NEO: Sync event node + relationships
    WH-->>IREX: 200 OK
    
    Note over IREX,UI: Topology Query Flow
    UI->>NEO: GET /api/data/topology
    NEO-->>UI: Graph nodes + relationships
    
    Note over IREX,UI: Dashboard Stats Flow
    UI->>PG: GET /api/data/stats
    PG-->>UI: Aggregated counts
    
    Note over IREX,UI: Time-Series Flow
    UI->>INF: GET /api/cloudinary/metrics
    INF-->>UI: Historical usage data
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Neo4j for Topology**: All graph relationships and network visualization queries use Neo4j exclusively. No PostgreSQL fallback for topology data.

2. **Immediate Sync**: When webhooks are received, data is synced to Neo4j immediately (non-blocking) to ensure topology is always up-to-date.

3. **PostgreSQL for Metadata**: PostgreSQL stores only application configuration, user data, webhook logs, and minimal dashboard metadata for counts/stats.

4. **InfluxDB for Trends**: All time-series data (Cloudinary usage, throttle metrics) is stored in InfluxDB for efficient historical queries.

### Database-Integrated REST APIs (Vercel Serverless)

These endpoints query real data from the PostgreSQL/TiDB database:

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Database Tables |
|----------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `/api/webhook/irex` | POST | Receives IREX webhook events and persists to database | `events`, `channels`, `snapshots`, `webhook_requests` |
| `/api/webhooks/recent` | GET | Returns recent webhook requests from database | `webhook_requests` |
| `/api/data/cameras` | GET | Returns camera/channel data with statistics | `channels` |
| `/api/data/events` | GET | Returns surveillance events with filtering | `events` |
| `/api/data/stats` | GET | Returns aggregated dashboard statistics | `events`, `channels` |
| `/api/data/incidents` | GET | Returns incident management data | `incidents` |
| `/api/data/pole-entities` | GET | Returns POLE entities with graph data | `pole_entities` |
| `/api/analytics/time-series` | GET | Returns time-aggregated data for analytics visualizations | `events` |
| `/api/analytics/predictions` | GET | Returns forecasts, anomaly detection, trend analysis | `events` |

**Query Parameters:**
- `limit` - Maximum number of records to return
- `region` - Filter by region (e.g., `Lima`, `Cusco`)
- `status` - Filter by status (e.g., `active`, `inactive`, `alert`)
- `level` - Filter by priority level (0-3)
- `topic` - Filter by event topic (e.g., `FaceMatched`, `PlateMatched`)

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 150,
  "dbConnected": true,
  "cameras": [...] // or events, incidents, etc.
}
```

---

## 🔗 IREX Webhook Integration

The application receives and persists real-time surveillance events from IREX systems.

### Webhook Endpoint
```
POST /api/webhook/irex
```

### Supported Event Types
- `FaceMatched` - Face recognition matches from KX.Faces module
- `PlateMatched` - License plate matches from KX.PDD module
- `Motion`, `Intrusion`, `Loitering`, `Crowd` - Analytics events

### Payload Structure
```json
{
  "monitor_id": 114,
  "id": "203:1691055920965:4829655691653739",
  "event_id": "4829655691653739",
  "topic": "FaceMatched",
  "module": "KX.Faces",
  "level": 1,
  "start_time": 1685973361368,
  "end_time": 1685973369197,
  "params": { ... },
  "snapshots": [
    { "type": "FULLSCREEN", "path": "/api/v1/media/snapshot/..." },
    { "type": "THUMBNAIL", "path": "/api/v1/media/snapshot/..." }
  ],
  "channel": {
    "id": 274,
    "channel_type": "STREAM",
    "name": "CAM-001",
    "latitude": -12.0464,
    "longitude": -77.0428,
    "address": { "country": "Peru", "region": "Lima", "city": "Lima" },
    "tags": [{ "id": 170, "name": "Face" }]
  }
}
```

### Data Persistence
When a webhook is received, the system:
1. **Upserts the channel** - Creates or updates camera info in `channels` table
2. **Inserts the event** - Stores event details in `events` table
3. **Inserts snapshots** - Stores snapshot paths in `snapshots` table
4. **Logs the request** - Records full payload in `webhook_requests` table

See `Webhooks json description.md` for complete payload documentation.

---

## 📊 Data Sources

The application uses **real database integration** for all surveillance data:

| Component | Data Source | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Real-time Webhooks | `webhook_requests` table | Live IREX events |
| Geographic Map | `channels` table | Camera locations |
| Executive Dashboard | `events` + `channels` tables | Aggregated statistics |
| Event Timeline | `events` table | Historical events |
| Incident Management | `incidents` table | Incident tracking |
| POLE Analytics | `pole_entities` table | Real database integration (Dec 2024) |

**Empty State Handling:**
When no data exists in the database, the UI displays appropriate "No data yet" messages instead of mock data.

3. Add navigation link in `client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

### Adding New API Endpoints

1. Add procedure to `server/routers.ts`
2. Add database helper to `server/db.ts` if needed
3. Update schema in `drizzle/schema.ts` if needed
4. Run `pnpm db:push` to apply schema changes

### Customizing Theme

Edit `client/src/index.css` to change colors:

```css
:root {
  --primary: 0 71% 47%; /* Peru red */
  --background: 222 47% 11%; /* Dark gray */
  /* ... */
}
```
